# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that you can play in your browser.

## Introduction

This project is part of a JavaScript course where we're tasked with creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a basic user interface where players can take turns clicking on the game board to place their marks (X or O). The game logic checks for winning combinations and determines when the game ends in a win or a draw.

## How to Play

1. Open the [Tic Tac Toe](https://ismat-samadov.github.io/TicTacToe/) game in your browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty square on the board to place their mark (X or O).
3. The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination of marks (three in a row, column, or diagonal) or when all squares are filled without a winner (draw).
4. Click the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Game status display to indicate whose turn it is and the outcome of the game (win or draw).
- Ability to restart the game at any time.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
